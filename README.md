# face-matching-api
This is a real-time face-matching API that inputs an image captured from a webcam, and a roll number associated with it compares both in the database with the relative encodings generated for that person and returns true and false.

It is very effective in using CBT test scenarios where image feeds of many students are verified in real-time and defaulters can be identified.
