# face-matching-api
This is a real-time face matching api that inputs image captured from webcam, and a roll number associated with it, compares both in the database with the relative ecodings generated for that person and returns true and false.

It is very effective in using in CBT tests scenerio where image feeds of many students is verified in real time and defaulters could be identified.
